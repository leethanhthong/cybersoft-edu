      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the
      seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. <br />
      The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its
      origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius and
      Réunion in the Indian Ocean. <br />
      The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. <br />
      Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the
      equatorial reegions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India and Africa.
      <br />
      The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta. <br />
      Once ripe, cofffe berries are picked, processed, and dried. <br />
      Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees,
      depending on the desired flavor. <br />
      Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water tp produce
      coffee as a beverage.
